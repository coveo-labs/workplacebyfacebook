# Indexing Workplace by Facebook Using the Generic REST API Connector

## Use Case
This shows how to index Workplace by Facebook.

## Prerequisites
To fully understand how to use this example, you must:
1. Have a Coveo Platform organization.
2. Learn about [Coveo Connectivity](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1702/).
3. Learn [how to configure a Generic REST API source](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/).

## Instructions
1. [Create a Custom Integration into Workplace by Facebook](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/workplace/custom-integrations-new/).
2. Make sure the Integration has the following access: Read group content, Read user timeline, Read user email, Read group membership, Read all messages, Create link previews, Read work profile, Manage Knowledge Library content.
3. Use the `Access Token` as `API Key` in your Generic Rest configuration.
4. [Create 2 Generic REST API Sources](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/). One for the content which supports incremental indexing, one for the content which does not support incremental indexing. 
5. Use in both sources the security setup in [SecurityConfig.json](https://github.com/coveooss/connectivity-library/blob/master/WorkplaceByFacebook/index/SecurityConfig.json). 
6. Add the  [IncrementalConfig.json](https://github.com/coveooss/connectivity-library/blob/master/WorkplaceByFacebook/index/IncrementalConfig.json). To the 'Incremental indexing' source. Make sure to setup an incremental indexing schedule for every 10 minutes.
7. Add the  [NormalConfig.json](https://github.com/coveooss/connectivity-library/blob/master/WorkplaceByFacebook/index/NormalConfig.json). To the 'Normal indexing' source.
8. Add the Extension script [FixFacebookURL.py](https://github.com/coveooss/connectivity-library/blob/master/WorkplaceByFacebook/FixFacebookURL.py) to your organization.
9. Assocatie the Extension script to the `Incremental Source`.
10. Make sure you've changed all placeholders in the configuration with your own values.
11. [Create the appropiate fields and mappings](https://docs.coveo.com/en/1896/#completion).

## Content indexed
* Groups (documenttype `GroupFB`)
* Groups > Posts (documenttype `PostFB`)
* Groups > Posts > Attachments (documenttype `AttachmentFB`)
* Groups > Posts > Comments (documenttype `CommentFB`)
* Groups > Docs (documenttype `DocFB`)
* Groups > Events (documenttype `EventFB`)
* Groups > Albums (documenttype `AlbumFB`)
* KnowledgeArticles (documenttype `KnowledgeFB`)


Attachments are completely downloaded and full text indexed.

Comments can contain nested comments, they are indexed as a single comment item (comment + nested comments).

** Only Posts supports incremental indexing, be-aware of the duplicate entries in `RefreshEndpoints` **

### Folding
For Posts with Comments & Attachments folding is enabled.
For both the field `foldingcollection` is defined. For the parent (Posts), the field `foldingparent` is defined. For the childs (comments, attachments) the field `foldingchild` is defined.

### Custom fields
The following custom fields must be created:
| Field        | Type           | Features  |
| ------------- |-------------|-----|
| id       | string |  |
| groupid  | Integer 64 | |
| postid   | String | |
| mediaurl | String      |     |
| iconurl  | String     | |
| mymessage | String  | Free Text, Ranking, Stemming |
| mystory   | String  | Free Text, Ranking, Stemming |


## Security indexed
Workplace by Facebook is using security based upon Community Members and Group Members. The configuration indexes both.

## Limitation
Nested community groups are not supported

## Special attention
Posts can contain a message and/or a story. The field `mymessage` and/or `mystory` is added to the content. `message` is a better fit, so if that is there, use that one.
